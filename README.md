# About this repo

- All is organized by folders
- Contents are be separated by content type
- I use gitignore on files compiled by gcc to make it more legible
- If you wanna test it on your computer, just copy the code and compile it
- Use # gcc -o [filename] [filename.c] : it'll make a new file
- To execute it use # ./namefile
- Have some fun reading this :)
